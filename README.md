==================================

Assignment for CodePath iOS-Swift Observer group

Create a Swift App to show movies info from Rotten Tomatoes.

Requirements

Completed: User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. Poster images must be loading asynchronously.

Incomplete: User can view movie details by tapping on a cell. View created but I was unable to pass the movie index to the segue.

Incomplete: User sees loading state while waiting for movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries at cocoacontrols.com. Control downloaded but not implemented

Hours used: 20

Notes: It's pretty frustrating not to find documentation with examples for simple tasks for beginners.
